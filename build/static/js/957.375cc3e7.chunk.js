Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. As I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was fascinating, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing. I latched on to any idea for projects I could get, moving from \"Hello World\" all the way to a simple First-person Shooter Engine, with dozens of projects in between, I learned C, then C++, tearing through any books could find on anything remotely related to software development.i was insatiable. This passion carried me through my education at Acharya institutes. Here there were more resources to me than I ever could have imagined. studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me. And it was here that learned truly how much there was yet to learn. So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I'm very grateful."}),(0,r.jsx)("a",{href:"#contact",className:"btn btn-primary align__btn",children:"Let's Talk"})]})]})]})})}}}]);
